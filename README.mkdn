# NAME

OPM::Maker::Command::sopm - Build .sopm file based on metadata

# VERSION

version 1.2.0

# DESCRIPTION

SOPM files are used for ticket system addon creation (e.g. for Znuny, OTOBO, ((OTRS)) Community Edition).
They define some metadata like the vendor, their URL, packages required or required Perl modules. 
It is an XML file and it's no fun to create it. It is not uncommon that the list of files included in the
addon is not updated before the addon is built and released.

That's why this package exists. You can define the metadata and stuff like database changes in a JSON file
and the file list is created automatically. And you don't have to write the XML tags repeatedly.

# INSTALLATION PHASES

When an addon is installed, it happens in several phases

- 1 CodeInstall - type "pre"
- 2 DatabaseInstall - type "pre"
- 3 Files are installed
- 4 Include SysConfig
- 5 DatabaseInstall - type "post"
- 6 CodeInstall - type "post"

These types are important in some cases and you'll see them later.

# CONFIGURATION

You can configure this command with a JSON file.

## A simple add on

This configuration file defines only the metadata.

    {
       "name": "Test",
       "version": "0.0.3",
       "framework": [
           "3.0.x"
       ],
       "vendor": {
           "name":  "Perl-Services.de",
           "url": "http://www.perl-services.de"
       },
       "license": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, November 2007",
       "description" : {
           "en": "Test sopm command"
       }
    }

And this .sopm will be created (assuming the file exists)

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <otrs_package version="1.0">
      <!-- GENERATED WITH OPM::Maker::Command::sopm (1.27) -->
      <Name>Test</Name>
      <Version>0.0.3</Version>
      <Framework>3.0.x</Framework>
      <Vendor>Perl-Services.de</Vendor>
      <URL>http://www.perl-services.de</URL>
      <Description Lang="en">Test sopm command</Description>
      <License>GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, November 2007</License>
      <Filelist>
          <File Permission="644" Location="01_simple_json.t" />
          <File Permission="644" Location="02_intro.t" />
      </Filelist>
    </otrs>

## Support more than one framework version

If the module runs on several framework version, you can define them in the list of frameworks

    "framework": [
        "3.0.x",
        "3.1.x",
        "3.2.x",
        "3.2.x"
    ],

And they will all be listed in the .sopm

    <Framework>3.0.x</Framework>
    <Framework>3.1.x</Framework>
    <Framework>3.2.x</Framework>
    <Framework>3.3.x</Framework>

## Required packages and modules

Some addons depend on other addons and/or Perl modules. So it has to define those prerequesits.

    "requires": {
        "package" : {
            "TicketOverviewHooked" : "3.2.1"
        },
        "module" : {
            "Digest::MD5" : "0.01"
        }
    },

Creates those tags

    <PackageRequired Version="3.2.1">TicketOverviewHooked</PackageRequired>
    <ModuleRequired Version="0.01">Digest::MD5</ModuleRequired>

## Database changes

### Create new table

### Insert stuff

### Change Column

## Code execution

You can execute code when an addon is installed. As you can see above, there are to 
phases when code can be executed.

### Run "post" code

Sample config

    "code" : [
        { "type" : "Install" },
        { "type" : "Uninstall" }
    ]

This creates

    <CodeInstall Type="post"><![CDATA[
        $Kernel::OM->Get('var::packagesetup::' . $Param{Structure}->{Name}->{Content} )->CodeInstall();
    ]]></CodeInstall>
    <CodeUninstall Type="post"><![CDATA[
        $Kernel::OM->Get('var::packagesetup::' . $Param{Structure}->{Name}->{Content} )->CodeUninstall();
    ]]></CodeUninstall>

You need to provide the `var::packagesetup::xxxxx` package (where _xxxxx_ is the name of the addon).

There are four types:

- Install
- Upgrade
- Reinstall
- Uninstall

The methods called are usually named `CodeInstall`, `CodeUninstall`, etc. If you need to run an other
method, you can specify the method to be called:

    "code" : [
        { "type" : "Install", "function": "OtherMethod" }
    ]

And that would create

    <CodeInstall Type="post"><![CDATA[
        $Kernel::OM->Get('var::packagesetup::' . $Param{Structure}->{Name}->{Content} )->OtherMethod();
    ]]></CodeInstall>

Usually you would run the code after the files
are installed and database changes are done. But sometime you need to run code before
this stuff is done. As the packagesetup file isn't available you, you would need to provide
the Perl code in the JSON file. That's nasty. With _inline_ you can tell this command
to get the Perl code from a file.

### Options

- type
- version
- phase
- function
- inline

# METHODS

## VERSION



# Development

The distribution is contained in a Git repository, so simply clone the
repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/perlservices/OPM-Maker-Command-sopm.git
```

and change into the newly-created directory.

```
$ cd OPM-Maker-Command-sopm
```

The project uses [`Dist::Zilla`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) to
build the distribution, hence this will need to be installed before
continuing:

```
$ cpanm Dist::Zilla
```

To install the required prequisite packages, run the following set of
commands:

```
$ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
$ dzil listdeps --author --missing | cpanm
```

The distribution can be tested like so:

```
$ dzil test
```

To run the full set of tests (including author and release-process tests),
add the `--author` and `--release` options:

```
$ dzil test --author --release
```
